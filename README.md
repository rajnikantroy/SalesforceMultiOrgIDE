# SalesforceMultiOrgIDE
Salesforce Multiple Org IDE | Salesforce Comparator | Salesforce Multi Org Comparator by Salesforce Simplified
Salesforce Multi-Org IDE will be different domain like a workbench. This will be a public GitHub repository from where anyone will be able to perform all GitHub actions like commit, push, pull etc.

 Functionality
We will help developers to compare the metadata list, metadata details comparator like any text compare tool. If there will be something different we will be able to make similar by drag text or metadata from one org to other.

 There are three parts of Salesforce Multi-Org IDE
Metadata comparator
Update any metadata(Class/Trigger Editor)
Exchange metadata by simply drag and drop

 Metadata comparator
There will be 2 types of comparison
List of metadata comparison(Classes, Trigger, Pages, Objects, Workflow etc.)
Text comparator (Classes, Trigger, Pages or any text-based metadata)

 List of metadata comparison(Classes, Trigger, Pages, Objects, Workflow)
 By list of metadata comparator, we will be able to easily identify how many classes/trigger/other metadata are there. If we will find any discrepancies we will be able to select multiple metadata and we can easily drag and drop to another sandbox.

Text comparator (Classes, Trigger, Pages or any text-based metadata)
 After selecting any metadata like classes/triggers/pages, the same page will get opened on both salesforce org. It will show difference just like beyond compare.

  Metadata details page will get opened on editable mode and just like beyond compare or any other text compare push the difference to another side. We will be able to do that.

 In short, you will be able to deploy your code by just drag and drop functionality.
